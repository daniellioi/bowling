# bowling
a quick c++ command line program as an exercise to see what I could get done in a few hours
some of the code is better than other parts particularly in regards to testing, I felt I was using too much time towards the end.  If I was going to spend more time I would do something about bowling_ui, bowling_game, and BowlingGameState::roll

to build type
`make`
to run test
`./bowling_test`

to run game
`./bowl`
hit space to roll or q to quit
